# credit-card-customer-churn-prediction-
Repository Name: credit-card-customer-churn-prediction 💳🔍

Description:

This repository features a machine learning project designed to predict customer churn for credit card companies. By leveraging a Kaggle dataset, the project aims to identify customers likely to cancel their credit card services, helping companies take proactive measures to retain valuable clients. 🚀📉

Key Features:

Data Analysis 📊: Comprehensive exploration and preprocessing of the Kaggle dataset, including feature engineering and data cleaning.
Model Building 🤖: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict customer churn.
Performance Evaluation 📈: Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Visualization 📉: Insights and visualizations of churn patterns and model performance using tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
